# Longfin-Smelt-Growth-Model
Data and code to support the growth model in the Longfin Smelt SSA.

## Overview

This repository contains data and code to support the development of a model of apparent growth for the Bay-Delta DPS of [Longfin Smelt (*Spirinchus thaleichthys*)](https://www.fws.gov/species/longfin-smelt-spirinchus-thaleichthys). The model developed here was designed to assess variation in apparent growth of Longfin Smelt using a combination of observed environmental conditions (e.g., water temperature, conductivity, outflow, density, and prey availability) and random effects. We did this by estimating parameters for the Lester biphasic growth model.

Data for this study were derived from the Interagency Ecological Program's [long-term monitoring data](https://iep.ca.gov/Data/IEP-Survey-Data). Information on the assignment of ages to Longfin Smelt can be found in the github repository for the development of length at date criteria for the Bay-Delta DPS of Longfin Smelt: <https://github.com/USFWS/Longfin-Smelt-Length-at-Date>.

This code was used in Appendix D of the [Species Status Assessment (SSA)](https://www.fws.gov/node/4531791) for the Bay-Delta DPS of Longfin Smelt. Further development of this project may also occur.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, users should install R and Template Model Builder.
